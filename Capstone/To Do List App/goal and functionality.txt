Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a ToDo List web application using 
Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application will allow users to create 
and view tasks. Tasks will not persist between sessions as no database 
will be used in this version of the application. Styling will be an important 
aspect of this project to ensure a good user experience.

Deliverables
- One Node project for the function of the website
- Including at least one EJS file for the structure of the website
- Including at least one CSS file for the styling of the website


Features
1. Task Creation: Users should be able to create new tasks.
2. Task Viewing: Users should be able to view a list of all their tasks.
3. Task Completion: Users should be able to strike through their completed 
tasks in the todo list. Tasks do not need to be deleted.
4. Segmented Lists: Users should be able to access at least 2 lists, one for 
the day's tasks and another for their work related tasks. (See example website)
3. Styling: The application should be well-styled and responsive, ensuring a 
good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
